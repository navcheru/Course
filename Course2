Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.


Naveen Cheruku
Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a problem-solving technique that breaks complex problems into smaller subproblems. 
It stores solutions to avoid redundant computations, making it efficient. 
DP is used for tasks like finding Fibonacci numbers, common subsequences, shortest paths, and solving the knapsack problem. 
Itâ€™s a powerful tool for optimization
